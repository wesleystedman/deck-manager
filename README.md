# Wesley's Deck Manager

This is a deck manager tool meant to work with Magic: The Gathering Arena.  It provides a more accessible means of saving a deck you saw online or jotting down some deck ideas.  Eventually, it may become a more powerful and flexible tool than Magic Arena's own deck management interfaces.
