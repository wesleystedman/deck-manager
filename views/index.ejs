<h1>Wesley's Deck Manager</h1>
<p>Welcome! This is an unofficial, fan-made deck manager for <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena"
        target="_blank">Magic: The Gathering Arena</a>. While this site can't interact with your Magic Arena account
    directly, I'm sure you'll find it much more convenient to come here than to open the client if you're looking to
    save a deck you found online or quickly sketch out an idea.</p>
<p>To get started, just sign in with your Google account, then use the links in the header to add or browse decks.</p>
